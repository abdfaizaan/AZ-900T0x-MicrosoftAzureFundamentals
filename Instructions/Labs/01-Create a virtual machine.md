# Lab 01 - Create a Virtual machine in the portal

### Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Lab Overview

An Azure virtual machine (VM) is a computing resource provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to create and use virtualized computing instances in the cloud. Azure Virtual Machines enable users to run applications, host websites, and perform various computing tasks without needing to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

In this walkthrough, we will create a virtual machine in the Azure portal, connect to the virtual machine, install the web server role and test.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine
+ Task 2: Connect to the Virtual Machine
+ Task 3: Host a Basic Website on your New Cloud VM

### Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine

In this task, we will create a Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - Gen2 virtual machine. 

1. On the **Azure Portal** page, in Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines (1)**, and then select **Virtual machines (2)** under services.

1. Click **Next : Disks >** to switch to the **Disks** tab. In the **OS Disk type** select **Standard HDD** from the dropdown and leave everything else as default and click **Next : Networking >**. 

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/hdd.png)

1. Within the **Networking** tab, look for **Select inbound ports** and leave other settings as default:

    | Settings | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Select inbound ports | **HTTP (80), RDP (3389)**|

    ![](../images/az-900-3.png)    
   
    >**Note:**  Verify that both port 80 and 3389 are selected

1. Click **Next : Management >** to switch to the **Management** tab and leave everything as default.

1. Click **Next : Monitoring >** to switch to the **Monitoring** tab, select the following setting:

    | Settings | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Boot diagnostics | **Disable**|

    ![](../images/az-900-4.png)        
  
1. Leave the remaining as default and then click on the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Once validation is passed, click on the **Create** button. It will take around five to seven minutes for the virtual machine to get deployed.

   ![](../images/az-900-5.png) 

1. You will receive updates on the deployment page and via the **Notifications** area (the bell icon in the top menu).

   >**Note**: Here is the reference link for the virtual machine https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine/

### Task 2: Connect to the Virtual Machine

In this task, we will connect to our new virtual machine using RDP. 

1. Once the deployment is complete, click on the **Go to resource** option. You will be redirected to the newly created virtual machine's page.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/az-900images.png)
   
1. On the virtual machine **Overview** blade, click the **Connect** button and choose the **Connect** from the dropdown.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](../images/conrdp.png)

    >**Note:** The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this Remote Desktop Client from the Mac App Store and on a Linux computer you can use an open source RDP client.

1. Within the **Connect** page, click on **Download RDP File**.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](../images/downrdp.png)

1. Once the file is downloaded,you will be directed with a warning, click on **Keep**.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](./images/new-az-900-lab1.jpg)

1. **Open** the downloaded RDP file and click **Connect** when prompted. 

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](./images/az-900-37.png)

1. In the **Windows Security** window, select **More choices (1)** and then choose **Use a different account (2)**. Provide the username as `.\azureuser` **(3)** and the password `Pa$$w0rd1234` **(4)**. Then click **OK (5)** to connect.

    ![Screenshot of the Windows security dialogue with use a different account selected and the username azure user entered and a password.](../images/az-900-6.png)

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click on **Yes** to create the connection and connect to your deployed VM. You should be able to connect successfully.

### Task 3: Host a Basic Website on your New Azure Cloud VM

In this task, you will install the web server role on the server and host a basic website.

1. In the **Server Manager** (which should launch automatically) once you connect to the vm, select **Add roles and features** as shown below in the screenshot: 

    ![server manager](../images/az900-t3_s1.png)

    >**Note:** If you get a pop-up related to **Networking** click **No**. If you get a tab Server Manager, close the tab.
    
    ![server manager](../images/network.png)

1. Within the **Before you begin** page, click on **Next >**.

1. Ensure **Role-based or feature-based installation** is selected. Click **Next >**.

1. Ensure **Select a server from the server pool (1)** is selected, and that your VM appears **(2)** in the list below. Click on **Next > (3)**.

   ![](../images/az-900-7.png) 

1. In the Server roles list, scroll to near bottom of the list and select **Web Server (IIS) (1)**. Click on **Add Features (2)**.

    ![server pool](../images/az-900-8.png)

1. Click on **Next >** until you reach the **Confirm installation selections** page, and make sure that the **Restart the destination server automatically if required (1)** is checked. Then click on **Install (2)**.

    ![Restart the destination check box](../images/az-900-9.png)

    >**Note:** If a pop-up appears warning about the automatic server restart, select **Yes**.

1. When the installation completes, click on **Close**. Back on the **Server Manager** portal, go to **Tools** > **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_s9.png)

1. In the **Internet Information Services (IIS)** **Manager** window, locate your server’s **Default Web Site** in the **Connections** tree.

    ![](../images/az-900-10.png)

1. Now, click on **Basic Settings** in the **Actions** menu. In the new pop-up dialog box, locate the **Physical Path** and click **Ok**. This is where you will put your website HTML file.

    ![](../images/az900-t3_s12.png)

   >**Note:** Keep a note of the path as it will be required in the preceding steps.

1. Go to the Physical Path location specified in the Basic Settings(C:\inetpub\wwwroot). Navigate to the `File explore` from the botton then Copy and paste **iisstart.html** file in the same location. Rename the new file to **Default**. RIght click on Default.html file click on **Open With > Notepad** and delete the existing content then paste the below code into the same file and save the file.

    >**Note**: If you have trouble copying **iisstart.html**, select the **iisstart.html** and use **Ctrl + C** to copy and **Ctrl + V** to paste it.

    ```
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Demo Website</h1>
        <p>This is my first cloud hosted website.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    ![](../images/root.png)

1. Now, back in the **Azure Portal**, navigate back to the **Overview** blade of **myVM** and use the **Copy to clipboard** button to copy the **public IP address** of 
   **myVm**.

    ![](../images/az-900-13.png)

1. Open a new browser tab, paste the public IP address into the URL text box, and press the Enter key to browse to it. The custom created basic website shows up.

## Summary

In this exercise, we created a virtual machine (VM) in the cloud and connected to it successfully. We then hosted a basic website on the new cloud VM, gaining hands-on experience with virtual machine setup, remote access, and web hosting. Throughout the exercise, we learned essential skills for managing cloud resources and deploying web applications on virtual machines.
