# Lab 01 - Create a virtual machine in the portal

## Lab Overview

An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a computing resource provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to create and use virtualized computing instances in the cloud. Azure Virtual Machines enable users to run applications, host websites, and perform various computing tasks without needing to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

In this walkthrough, we will create a virtual machine in the Azure portal, connect to the virtual machine, install the web server role and test.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the virtual machine
+ Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine
+ Task 3: Host a Basic Website on your New Cloud VM

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

**Note**: Take time during this walk-through to click and read the Informational icons.

### Task 1: Create the virtual machine

In this task, we will create a Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - Gen2 virtual machine. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box** at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines (1)**, and then select **Virtual machines (2)** under services.

    | Virtual machine name | **myVm** (3)|
    | Location | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** (4)|
    | Image | **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - x64 Gen2** (5)|

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Select inbound ports | **HTTP (80), RDP (3389)**|

     ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](./images/az900-4.png)    
   
      >**Note:** - Verify that both port 80 and 3389 are selected.

1. On the **Management** tab and leave everything as default.

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Boot diagnostics | **Disable**|

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](./images/az900-5.png)      
  
1. Once **Validation** is passed click the **Create** button. It can take anywhere from five to seven minutes to deploy the virtual machine.

1. You will receive updates on the deployment page and via the **Notifications** area (the bell icon in the top menu).

   >**Note**: Here is the reference link for virtual machine https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine/.

### Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine

In this task, we will connect to our new virtual machine using RDP. 

1. Once the deployment is complete, click on **Go to resource** you will be directed to the page of the newly created Virtual Machine.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](./images/az900-6.png)
   
1. On the virtual machine **Overview** blade, click the **Connect (1)** button and choose the **Connect (2)** from the dropdown.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted.](./images/az900-7.png)

    >**Note:** The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this Remote Desktop Client from the Mac App Store and on a Linux computer you can use an open source RDP client.

1. Within the **Connect** page, click on **Download RDP File**.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](./images/az900-8.png)

1. Once the file is downloaded,you will be directed with a warning, click on **Keep**.

1. **Open** the downloaded RDP file.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](./images/az900-9.png)

1. Click **Connect** when prompted.
