# Lab 13 - Secure network traffic

### Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Lab overview

A Network Security Group (NSG) is a fundamental component of the network security architecture within Microsoft Azure. It acts as a basic, stateful, and centralized firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), virtual machines (VM), and Azure Virtual Network (VNet) resources.

In this walkthrough, we will configure a network security group.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, You will be able to complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Virtual machine
+ Task 2: Create a network security group
+ Task 3: Configure an inbound security port rule to allow RDP
+ Task 4: Configure an outbound security port rule to deny Internet access

    ![Screenshot of the error message that the virtual machine connection has failed.](../images/1201.png)

1. From the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Network security groups**. Select **myNSGSecure (attached to network interface: simplewinvm<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"/>)**. This Network security group deny all inbound traffic except traffic within the virtual network and load balancer probes.

1. From the left navigation pane, under **Settings** select **Inbound security rules**.

1. On the **Inbound security rules (1)** tab, click **+ Add (2)**

    ![](../images/az-900-137.png)    

1. On the **Add inbound security rule** provide the below values to the respective settings and  Click **Add (10)**. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Source | **Any (1)**|
    | Source port ranges | **\* (2)** |
    | Destination | **Any (3)** |
    | Service | **Custom (4)** |
    | Destination port ranges | **3389 (5)** |
    | Protocol | **TCP (6)** |
    | Action | **Allow (7)** |
    | Priority | **300 (8)** |
    | Name | **AllowRDP (9)** |
  
    ![](../images/az-900-138.png)    

1. Wait for the rule to be provisioned and then try again to RDP into the virtual machine using downloaded rdp file. This time you should be successful. Remember the user is **azureuser** and the password is **Pa$$w0rd1234**.

### Task 4: Configure an outbound security port rule to deny Internet access

In this task, we will create a NSG outbound port rule that will deny Internet access and then test to ensure the rule is working.

1. Continue in your virtual machine RDP session. If pop-up comes then select **yes**.

1. After the machine starts, open an **Internet Explorer** browser, then click on **Ok**. 

1. Open a New tab in the browser and browse to **https://www.bing.com** , and then close Internet Explorer Pop-ups. You will need to work through the IE enhanced security pop-ups. The page is displayed.

    **Note**: We will now configure a rule to deny outbound internet access. 

1. Minimize the RDP session to navigate back to **Azure Portal**.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the network security group, select **myNSGSecure**. 

1. From the left navigation menu, under **Settings**, select **Outbound security rules (1)**. Notice there is a rule, **AllowInternetOutbound (2)**. This is a default rule and cannot be removed. 

    ![](../images/az-900-139.png)    

1. Select **+ Add**, on the **Add outbound security rule.**

    ![](../images/az-900-141.png)    

1. Configure a new outbound security rule with a higher priority that will deny internet traffic. Click **Add (11)** after configuring the below settings. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Source | **Any (1)**|
    | Source port ranges | **\* (2)** |
    | Destination | **Service Tag (3)** |
    | Destination service tag | **Internet (4)** |
    | Service | **Custom (5)** |
    | Destination port ranges | **\* (6)** |
    | Protocol | **Any (7)** |
    | Action | **Deny (8)** |
    | Priority | **4000 (9)** |
    | Name | **DenyInternet (10)** |
   
    ![](../images/new-az-900-6.jpg)
    ![](../images/new-az-900-5.jpg)     

    >**Note**: Once outbound rule is created please make sure to check Destination port ranges should be as **\*** if values are reverted kindly change it to **\*** and 
     click on **Save**.

1. Return to your RDP session. 

   >**Note** : If a security alert pop-up appears, select Yes to proceed.
