# Lab 05 - Create blob storage

### Estimated timing: 15 minutes

## Lab overview

Storage account is a resource that acts as a container that groups all the data services from Azure storage (Azure blobs, Azure files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables). This helps us manage all of them as a group.

In this walkthrough, we will create a storage account, and then work with blob storage files.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, You will be able to complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a storage account
+ Task 2: Work with blob storage
+ Task 3: Monitor the storage account

### Task 1: Create a storage account

In this task, we will create a new storage account. 

1. On the Azure portal, from the **Azure services** blade, search for **Storage accounts (1)** and select **Storage accounts (2)**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information.Leave the defaults for everything else, then click on **Next (7)**.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Choose the default subscription (1)** |
    | Resource group | **AZ-900-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (3)** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/> (4)**  |
    | Performance | **Standard (5)** |
    | Redundancy | **Locally redundant storage (LRS)(6)** |

### Task 2: Work with blob storage

In this task, we will create a Blob container and upload a blob file. 

1. Click on the **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** (newly created storage account).

   ![](./images/az-900-60.png) 

1. From the left navigation pane under **Data storage** section, click **Containers (1)**. Click **+ Container (2)** and complete the information. Use the Information icons to learn more. When done click **Create (5)**.

   | Setting | Value |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | Name | **container1 (3)**|
   | Anonymous access level| **Private (no anonymous access) (4)** |

   ![](./images/az-900-47.png)    
  
1. Click the **container1** container.

   ![](./images/az-900-48.png) 

1. Click on **Upload**.

   ![](./images/az-900-49.png) 

1. Click on **Browse to a file (1)** then select **Test.txt (3)** that you created in a previous task, located on the **desktop (2)**. Then select the file and click **Open (4)**.

   ![](./images/az-900-50.png) 
  
1. Click the **Advanced** arrow, leave the default values but review the available options, and then click **Upload**.

   ![](./images/az-900-51.png) 

    >**Note:** You can upload as many blobs as you like in this way. New blobs will be listed within the container.

1. Once the file is uploaded, right-click on the file and notice the options including **View/edit, Download, Properties, and Delete**. 

   ![](./images/az-900-62.png) 

   >**Note:** In the event that the access level for the storage account is configured as public, accessing the contents of the storage account can be done through a URL. To gain a deeper understanding of Storage Account access levels, please go through the following link:[Access Levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure?tabs=portal)

1. As you have time, from the storage accounts blade, review the options for **Files, Tables, and Queues**.

### Task 3: Monitor the storage account

1. If needed, return to the **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** blade and from the left-navigation menu, click on the **Diagnose and solve problems**. 

   ![](./images/az-900-57.png) 

1. Explore some of the most common storage problems. Notice there are multiple troubleshooter.

1. On the storage account blade, from the left navigation menu, scroll down to the **Monitoring (1)** section and click **Insights (2)**. Notice there is information on *Failures, Performance, Availability, and Capacity*.

## Summary
In this exercise, we created a storage account and worked with blob storage to manage data efficiently. We also monitored the storage account to ensure optimal performance and health. Throughout the exercise, we gained practical experience in setting up and managing cloud storage, utilizing blob storage for data storage, and monitoring the account for any issues or performance metrics.
