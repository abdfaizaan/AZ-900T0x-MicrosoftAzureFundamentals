### Task 1: Configure the Cloud Shell(Optional)

**If you are launching Cloud shell for th first time, then do this task, otherwise please go to next task.**

In this task, we will configure Cloud Shell.

1. From the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

    >**Note:** If you have already used it before, you can proceed to Task 2.

1. If you're launching Cloud Shell for the first time, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). If so, select **PowerShell**.

1. On the **Create storage account** tab, provide the following details and select **Create (6)**.

    | Settings | Values |
    |  -- | -- |
    | Subscription | **Existing subscription (1)**|
    | Storage account name | **blob<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**|
    | Resource group | **AZ-900-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (3)** |
    | Location | **(US) East US (4)**|
    | File share | **none (5)**|

### Task 2: Create a Virtual Machine

In this task, we will use PowerShell to create a resource group and a virtual machine.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session, within the Cloud Shell pane, get existing resource group.

    ```
    Get-AZResourceGroup
    ```

1. Verify your resource group.

    ```
    Get-AzResourceGroup | Format-Table
    ```
    ![](./images/az-900-108.png)    

1. Create a virtual machine. When prompted provide the user as `azureuser` and the password: `Pa$$w0rd1234`. <br>This will be configured as the local Administrator account on that virtual machines. Ensure that you include the tick (`) characters at the end of each line except for the last one (there should not be any tick characters if you type entire command on a single line).

    ```
     New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName "AZ-900-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>" `
    -Name "myVMPS" `
    -Location "eastus" `
    -Size "Standard_B2s" `
    -Image "MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2022-datacenter-azure-edition:latest" `
    -VirtualNetworkName "myVnetPS" `
    -SubnetName "mySubnetPS" `
    -SecurityGroupName "myNSGPS" `
    -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpPS"
    ```

    ![](./images/az-900-96.png)    

    >**Note**: Wait for the VM to deploy before closing the PowerShell.

1. Close the PowerShell session Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Virtual machines** and verify the **myVMPS** is running. This may take a few minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machines page with myVMPS in a running state.](./images/az-900-97.png)

1. Access the new virtual machine and review the Overview and Networking settings to verify your information was correctly deployed.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
> - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help.

>**Note**: You can try validating the task after 3-5 minutes, if validations are failing.

### Task 3: Execute Commands in the Cloud Shell

In this task, we will practice executing PowerShell commands from the Cloud Shell.

1. From the Azure portal page, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. Retrieve information about your virtual machine including name, resource group, location, and status. Notice the PowerState is **running**.

    ```
    Get-AzVM -name myVMPS -status | Format-Table -autosize
    ```
    ![](./images/az-900-98.png)    

1. Stop the virtual machine. When prompted confirm (Yes) to the action.
    ```
    Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName AZ-900-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> -Name myVMPS
    ```
1. For **This cmdlet will stop the specified virtual machine. Do you want to continue?** enter **Y**.

   ![](./images/az-900-99.png)

1. Verify your virtual machine state. The PowerState should now be **deallocated**. You can also verify the virtual machine status in the portal.

    ```
    Get-AzVM -name myVMPS -status | Format-Table -autosize
    ```
    ![](./images/az-900-100.png)    

### Task 4: Review Azure Advisor Recommendations

> **Note:** This same task is also performed in hands-on-lab for **Create a VM with Azure CLI lab**.

In this task, we will review Azure Advisor recommendations for our virtual machine.

1. From the **Search resources,services and Docs** blade, search for **Advisor (1)** and select **Advisor (2)** from the services.

   ![](./images/az-900-101.png)

1. On the **Advisor** blade, select **Overview**. Notice recommendations are grouped by **Reliability, Security, Performance and Cost**.

    ![Screenshot of the Advisor Overview page. ](./images/az-900-102.png)

    >**Note:** Depending on your resources, your recommendations will be different and you might get the notification "You are following all of our performance recommendations".

1. Select **All recommendations** under **Recommendations** from the left navigation pane and take time to view each recommendation and suggested actions.

    >**Note:** Depending on your resources, your recommendations will be different and you might get the notification "You are following all of our performance recommendations".

    ![Screenshot of the Advisor All recommendations page. ](../images/l10.3.png)

1. Notice that from the **Security** option under **Recommendations** in the left navigation pane, you can download the recommendations as a **CSV or PDF file**.

    ![Screenshot of the Advisor All recommendations page. ](./images/az-900-103.png)

1. 1. Notice that from the **Alerts (Preview)** option in the left navigation pane, you can create alerts.

## Summary
In this exercise, we configured the Cloud Shell and created a virtual machine. We then executed commands within the Cloud Shell to manage resources and reviewed Azure Advisor recommendations to optimize the virtual machine setup. Throughout the exercise, we gained hands-on experience with Cloud Shell for managing Azure resources and leveraging Azure Advisor for best practice recommendations.

## Review
In this lab, you have completed:
- Configured the Cloud Shell
- Created a virtual machine
- Executed commands in the Cloud Shell
- Reviewed Azure Advisor Recommendations
